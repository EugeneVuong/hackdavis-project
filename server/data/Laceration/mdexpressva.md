Lacerations: Basic First Aid and Professional Treatment
npAt M.D. Express Urgent Care, we hope you are enjoying a safe and carefree spring. We want you to be familiar with the symptoms of minor and more serious lacerations and first-aid treatments for them. As seasons change, more people are outside, hiking or swimming, and going barefoot. The chance for a laceration increases with these activities.

What Is a Laceration?

A laceration can be anything from a small, minor scrape to a deep, bleeding cut. In a laceration, none of the skin is missing; it’s just separated. While some lacerations can seem minor, they may become serious if not treated properly and promptly.

First Aid for Lacerations

You should call 911 immediately if:

A cut is bleeding severely.
Blood is spurting out.
Bleeding can’t be stopped after 10 minutes of firm and steady pressure.
At Home Treatment of Lacerations

Standard first aid for lacerations (irregular, jagged cuts) should focus on thorough cleaning after stopping the bleeding, because lacerations tend to be contaminated with bacteria and debris from the object that caused the cut.

Stop the flow of blood by applying firm pressure to the laceration with a clean cloth or gauze. A small amount of blood is advantageous in cleansing the wound, but large amounts of blood loss can be dangerous.
Properly clean the wound. Remove all dirt and debris by first running cool water over the area, and then clean with a sterile cloth, warm water, and mild soap.
Apply antibiotic ointment, and then cover the wound area with a sterile gauze bandage and first-aid tape.
Clean the wound area daily with soap and water and apply a fresh sterile bandage.
For a minor laceration, remove the bandage after a couple of days to promote healing.
Professional Treatment of Lacerations

Deep or wide lacerations generally require medical assistance, as they probably will require stitches or staples. Stitching and stapling both:

Promote faster healing.
Help keep bacteria out of the wound.
Reduce the chance of infection.
Prevent unsightly scarring.
A cut needing stitches should be repaired within six hours of the injury. Cuts to the face and scalp can be repaired up to 24 hours after the injury; unless they are deep scrapes, which grind dirt into the skin.

In general, if a laceration is caused by gravel or penetrating glass or metal, an x-ray is a good idea to make sure no fragments remain within the wound. Fragments can cause permanent damage to skin and greatly increase infection risk.

If you suspect infection in a laceration, you’ll need to get medical attention immediately. Signs of infection include:

Redness
Swelling
Draining pus.
Increased pain or tenderness a day or more after the injury.
A medical professional will clean the wound and administer a tetanus or booster shot. In some cases, a doctor will prescribe an oral antibiotic.

You should seek medical attention if:

The wound is on your face.
The area feels numb — sometimes nerve injuries cause weakness, paralysis, or loss of sensation.
The wound is deep or jagged.
You can see fat, muscle, or bone; or suspect the laceration is over a joint.
The laceration (or puncture wound) is caused by an animal or human bite.
You have not had a tetanus shot in the past 5 to 10 years.
