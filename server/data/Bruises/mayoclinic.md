How to administer first aid for a bruise

By Mayo Clinic Staff
Overview
A bruise forms when blood vessels under the skin break. The trapped blood creates a bruise that's black, purple or blue then changes color as it heals.

Treatment
You can enhance bruise healing with a few simple techniques.

Elevate the bruised area above heart level, if possible.
Apply an ice pack wrapped in a thin towel. Leave it in place for 20 minutes. Repeat several times for a day or two after the injury. This helps to reduce the swelling and pain.
If the bruised area is swelling, put an elastic bandage around it, but not too tight.
If the skin isn't broken, you don't need to bandage a bruise. Consider taking a nonprescription pain reliever if needed.

Consult a healthcare professional if you:
Have very painful swelling in the bruised area.
Suspect a bruise has been caused by child abuse, domestic violence or elder abuse.
Still have pain three days after a minor injury.
Have frequent, large or painful bruises.
Have bruises that begin suddenly or seem to develop for no reason.
Have a personal or family history of easy bruising or bleeding.
Notice a lump form over the bruise, which may be a sign of pooling blood, also called a hematoma.
Have unusual bleeding, such as from the nose or gums.
